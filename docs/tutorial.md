# Tutorial

This Python client communicates with the Avatar platform.

For more information about the Avatar method and process, check out our main docs at https://docs.octopize.io

## Setup

The only remaining step before using the API is setting the endpoint and authenticating. We recommend using environment variables to provide the password.

```python
import os

# This is the client that you'll be using for all of your requests
from avatars.client import ApiClient

# The following are not necessary to run avatar but are used in this tutorial
import pandas as pd
import io

# Change this to your actual server endpoint, e.g. base_url="https://avatar.company.com"
client = ApiClient(base_url=os.environ.get("BASE_URL"))
client.authenticate(
    username="username", password=os.environ.get("AVATAR_PASSWORD", "strong_password")
)

# Verify that we can connect to the API server
client.health.get_health()
```

The Python client library is fully type-annotated. This will let you use interface hints from your IDE.

## Quickstart

This is all you need to run and evaluate an avatarization:

```python
from avatars.client import ApiClient
from avatars.models import AvatarizationJobCreate, AvatarizationParameters
import os

client = ApiClient(base_url=os.environ.get("BASE_URL"))
client.authenticate(username="username", password="strong_password")

dataset = client.datasets.create_dataset(open("fixtures/iris.csv", "r"))

job = client.jobs.create_full_avatarization_job(
    AvatarizationJobCreate(
        parameters=AvatarizationParameters(
            k=20,
            dataset_id=dataset.id,
        ),
    )
)
print(f"got job id: {job.id}")
job = client.jobs.get_avatarization_job(job.id)
print(job.result)
metrics = job.result.privacy_metrics
print(f"got privacy metrics : {metrics}")

# Download the avatars
df = client.pandas_integration.download_dataframe(job.result.avatars_dataset.id)
print(df.head())
```

## Avatarization step by step


### Setting the avatarization parameters

Hereâ€™s the list of parameters you can use for avatarization. The description for each parameter is available in our main docs.

- `k` (required)
- `dataset_id` (required): id of the dataset to avatarize
- `column_weights`: default=1 for each variable
- `ncp`: default=5.
- `imputation`: imputation parameters type of `ImputationParameters`.

  - `k`: number of neighbors for the knn imputation. default=5
  - `method`: method used for the imputation with `ImputeMethod`, default=`ImputeMethod.knn`)
  - `training_fraction`: the fraction of the dataset used to train the knn imputer. default=1

- `seed`: default=NULL.

These can all be set using the `AvatarizationParameters` object that you can import from `avatars.models` like so

```python
from avatars.models import AvatarizationParameters

parameters = AvatarizationParameters(dataset_id=dataset.id, k=5, ncp=7, seed=42)
```

### Launch an avatarization job

One job corresponds to one avatarization. 2 methods are available to create a job:

- (stand use) `create_full_avatarization_job` creates an avatarization job then computes metrics.
- (expert use) `create_avatarization_job` only creates an avatarization job.

```python
from avatars.models import AvatarizationJobCreate

job_create = AvatarizationJobCreate(parameters=parameters)
job = client.jobs.create_full_avatarization_job(request=job_create)

# You can retrieve the result and the status of the job (if it is running, has stopped, etc...).
# This call will block until the job is done or a timeout is expired.
# You can call this function as often as you want.
job = client.jobs.get_avatarization_job(id=job.id)
```

#### Retry mechanism

The `get_avatarization_job` function periodically queries the avatarization engine to check if a given job is finished.
This call will block until a given timeout has expired, and then return.
However, the job is still running on the server. You can call `get_avatarization_job` again, as many times as needed.
If the job is finished, the call finishes too.

You can modify this timeout by passing the `timeout` keyword to `get_avatarization_job`.

```python
# Will periodically retry until 10 seconds have passed
job = client.jobs.get_avatarization_job(id=job.id, timeout=10)
```

Sometimes, the job can fail. You can inspect the `Job` instance to see the status using `job.status`.

```python
print(job.status)  # prints "JobStatus.success"
```

Note that there is also the `per_request_timeout` keyword that is available. It specifies the timeout for one single request to the engine, while the `timeout` keyword is the global timeout that the method is allowed to take.
In other methods, only `timeout` is available as only a single call is made.

```python
# Will periodically retry for 10 seconds, and each request can take 2 seconds.
job = client.jobs.get_avatarization_job(id=job.id, per_request_timeout=2, timeout=10)
```

### Retrieving results

```python
# Once the avatarization is finished, you can retrieve the results of the avatarization,
# most notably the privacy metrics
result = job.result
print(f"got metrics : {result.privacy_metrics}")

# You will also be able to manipulate the avatarized dataset.
# Note that the order of the lines have been shuffled, which means that the link
# between original and avatar individuals cannot be made.
avatars_dataset_id = result.avatars_dataset.id
avatars_dataset = client.pandas_integration.download_dataframe(id=avatars_dataset_id)
print(avatars_df.head())
```

## Launch a whole pipeline

We have implemented the concept of pipelines.

```python
import pandas as pd

from avatars.client import ApiClient
from avatars.models import (
    AvatarizationJobCreate,
    AvatarizationParameters,
)
from avatars.models import AvatarizationPipelineCreate
from avatars.processors import ProportionProcessor

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "variable_1": [100, 150, 120, 100],
        "variable_2": [10, 30, 30, 22],
        "variable_3": [30, 60, 30, 35],
        "variable_4": [60, 60, 60, 65],
    }
)

dataset = client.pandas_integration.upload_dataframe(df)


proportion_processor = ProportionProcessor(
    variable_names=["variable_2", "variable_3", "variable_4"],
    reference="variable_1",
    sum_to_one=True,
)

result = client.pipelines.avatarization_pipeline_with_processors(
    AvatarizationPipelineCreate(
        avatarization_job_create=AvatarizationJobCreate(
            parameters=AvatarizationParameters(dataset_id=dataset.id, k=3),
        ),
        processors=[proportion_processor],
        df=df,
    )
)
```
